# Bioconductor

Open source software for bioinformatics

## The Role of S4 in Bioconductor:

* S3:
Positives:
Most CRAN packages use S3. Flexible but powerful. Reacts differently depending on the input.
example: plot() # there are many types of plots
Bad at validating types and naming conventions
Negatives:
Bad at validating types and naming conventions

* S4:
Positive:
Attempts to implement Object oriented programming
Formal definition of classes
Bioconductor reusability
Has validation of types
Naming conventions
Negative:
Complex structure compared to S3

* Is it S4 or not?
isS4(mydescriptor) 
[1] TRUE

str of S4 objects start with Formal class:
str(mydescriptor)
[1] Formal class 'GenomeDescription' [package "GenomeInfoDb"] with 7 slots
...

A class describes a representation:
name
slots
contains (inheritance definition)

* Example:
MyEpicProject <- setClass(# Define class name with UpperCamelCase
                          "MyEpicProject",
                          # Define slots, helpful for validation
                          slots = c(ini = "Date", 
                                    end = "Date", 
                                    milestone = "character"),
                          # Define inheritance        
                          contains = "MyProject")
